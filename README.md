# Holy Roller

Tired of chasing down those dice that fall off the table while gaming? Well tire no longer! Holy Roller allows you to roll multiple dice (and find the total) with the click or tap of a button.

Holy Roller was developed as a paired programming exercise with [Bernie Strong](https://github.com/bstrong71) and [Sean McPherson](https://github.com/seanmcp).
